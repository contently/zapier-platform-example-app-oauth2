# "OAuth2" Example App For Zapier Platform

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zapier/zapier-platform-example-app-oauth2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zapier/zapier-platform-example-app-oauth2)

A barebones app that has OAuth2 setup to interact with Contently!

## Current Oauth2 Flow:

For the official Zapier documentation, visit: https://github.com/zapier/zapier-platform-cli#oauth2

The flow for authentication can be found in `/authentication.js` and is as follows:

- `authorizeUrl` calls Contently's `/authorize` enpoint, passing various params including:
  -  `state` used by Zapier for verification purposes
  - `redirect_uri` generated by Zapier
- User is prompted to login, as route is secured
- the `/authorize` controller creates a `TempCode` with attributes:
  - `user` the contently user whose credentials were verified by login
  - `code` a string generated on the model instance on save
- After the `TempCode` instance is saved, controller directs to the `redirect_uri`
